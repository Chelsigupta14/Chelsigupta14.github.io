## 🧑‍💻 How It Was Done

1. Created a public repository named `Chelsigupta14.github.io` on GitHub.
2. Cloned the repository locally using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chelsigupta14/Chelsigupta14.github.io
   ```
3. Added the static website files:
   - `index.html` (structure)
   - `style.css` (styling)
   - `script.js` (interactivity)
4. Committed and pushed the code:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit with static website files"
   git push origin main
   ```
5. Enabled GitHub Pages from the repository’s **Settings → Pages** (source: `main` branch, root folder).
6. Visited the live site using the generated GitHub Pages link.
